# Introduction
Welcome to my Algorithm Visualizer. I started this project for myself and others to conveniently visualize how various algorithm functions.

As I learned and practiced new algorithms, I discovered that it is crucial to understand their step-by-step process.

Therefore, an algorithm visualizer is great for learning and remembering how different algorithms operates.

I hope this tool will be helpful for others that are also in the journey of learning and implementing algorithms.
